- **Subscription**: Verify that the appropriate subscription is selected from the dropdown menu
- **Name**: Assign a descriptive name to the Resource Group (e.g., "CloudInfraRG"). This will serve as the container for your VMs
- **Region**: Select **(US) East US 2**. Consistency in region selection across resources is critical to prevent configuration conflicts

Proceed by pressing **Next** until you reach the **Review + Create** section.

### Finalize Creation
Confirm the Resource Group details, including name and region, and select **Create**. Upon completion, you will be redirected to the Resource Groups section, where the new group will be visible.

- **VM Name**: Enter "windows-vm"
- **Region**: Select **(US) East US 2** to align with the Resource Group
- **Image**: Select **Windows 10 Pro, version 22H2** as the operating system (avoid selecting Windows Server images)

### Select VM Size

![VM Size Selection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0508247f-af54-4652-8298-5718952d2d57)

In the **Size** field, choose **Standard_D2s_v3 - 2 vCPUs, 8 GiB memory**. If unavailable, select **See all sizes** and choose an equivalent with at least 2 vCPUs and 8 GiB memory.

### Define Administrative Credentials

- Create a username and password for the VM. Store these credentials securely, as they are required for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access
- Under **Licensing**, check the box to confirm eligibility for Windows 10. This is mandatory for successful deployment

### Configure Disks
Select **Next: Disks** and retain the default disk configurations.

- Create a new Virtual Network (e.g., "cloud-vnet"). Record this name for future reference
- Retain default settings for Subnet, Public IP, and the RDP port (3389) to enable remote access
- Continue **Next** until you reach the **Review + Create** page

### Validate and Deploy

<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-03 at 10 02 10â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f9d1f08-ecaa-4772-9477-a11f5ec6d66f" />

Verify the configuration, including subscription, Resource Group, region, VM name, image, size, and RDP settings. Select **Create**.

### Monitor Deployment

## Step 3: Provision a Linux VM

### Initiate Linux VM Setup

<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-03 at 10 08 35â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b7c13ba-fda9-4ecc-a246-9e03a75893f5" />

From the VM creation screen, configure the following:
- **Resource Group**: Select the same Resource Group (e.g., "CloudInfraRG")
- **Name**: Enter "linux-vm"
- **Region**: Set to **(US) East US 2** for consistency
- **Image**: Choose **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS**

### Specify Size and Authentication

<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-03 at 10 09 00â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d30d2b95-5718-46be-9751-c6d017757b67" />
<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-03 at 10 10 30â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b5aa1e3-829b-4a71-9bab-264d9cae97dd" />


- **Size**: Select **Standard_D2s_v5 - 2 vCPUs, 8 GiB memory**, consistent with the Windows VM
- **Authentication type**: Set to **Password** (default is SSH public key)
- **Credentials**: Provide a username and password. For simplicity, you may reuse the Windows VM credentials. Store these securely

Select **Next** to proceed to disks and maintain the default settings. Proceed again by pressing **Next** to networking.

### Configure Networking

<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-03 at 10 10 59â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5dabd3d-3c98-4ea0-bdb1-7ce934d137fc" />

- **Virtual Network**: Choose the Virtual Network created for the Windows VM (e.g., "cloud-vnet")
- Retain default settings for Subnet and Public IP
- Continue **Next** until you reach the **Review + Create** page

### Validate and Deploy

<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-03 at 10 13 49â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8b7549e-8732-4101-9865-d1e2143923b2" />

Confirm the settings, including Resource Group, region, VM name, image, size, and network configuration. Select **Create**.

### Monitor Deployment and Review VMs


The deployment will take several minutes. Upon completion, the message "Your deployment is complete" will appear.

Use the search bar to return to **Virtual Machines**. Both "Windows-VM" and "Linux-VM" will be listed, displaying details such as resource group, region, operating system, and public IP addresses.

**Note**: The Start, Stop, and Restart options in the Virtual Machines section allow you to manage VM states. To optimize costs, stop VMs when not in use. For additional practice, you may delete the Resource Group and repeat the process.

## Conclusion

This procedure successfully establishes a Resource Group, a Windows VM running Windows 10 Pro, and a Linux VM running Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS in Microsoft Azure. These virtualized environments provide scalable, cost-efficient resources for IT operations, eliminating the need for physical hardware. 

Enterprises leverage such cloud solutions for their flexibility and economic benefits. Ensure VMs are stopped when idle to manage subscription costs.

**Key takeaways:**
- Both VMs are deployed in the same region and virtual network for optimal connectivity
- Authentication credentials are required for accessing both Windows (RDP) and Linux (SSH) VMs
- Resource management is critical for cost optimization in cloud environments

This concludes the deployment process.
